#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding top countries by population data to answer questions that would help a pharmaceutical determine where they should launch their new fertility drug.

#1. How many countries total are used in the data.
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM countries;

#2. What is the highet population density in the data?
SELECT MAX (density_per_sq_km) AS HighDensity FROM countries; 

#3. What is the lowest population density in the data?
SELECT MIN (density_per_sq_km) AS LowDensity FROM countries; 

#4. What is the average population density in the data?
SELECT AVG (density_per_sq_km) FROM countries; 

#5. Which countries have a density population less than the average number?
SELECT name, density_per_sq_km FROM countries GROUP BY name HAVING density_per_sq_km <358; 

#6. Which countries have a density population less than average AND have a median age that falls within the age range of when women have their first baby?
SELECT name,density_per_sq_km, median_age FROM countries WHERE density_per_sq_km <358 GROUP BY name HAVING median_age BETWEEN 25 AND 35;

#7. Display data in order to see which countries have a fertility rate that is below average, average and above average.
SELECT name, fertility_rate,
    CASE
        WHEN fertility_rate <2.1 THEN "below average"
        WHEN fertility_rate >=2.1 THEN "average"
        WHEN fertility_rate >5 THEN "above average"
    END as "fertility_zone"
FROM countries;

#8. How many countries have a fertility rate that falls within the below average?
SELECT COUNT (*),
    CASE
        WHEN fertility_rate <2.1 THEN "below average"
        WHEN fertility_rate >=2.1 THEN "average"
        WHEN fertility_rate >5 THEN "above average"
    END as "fertility_zone"
FROM countries
GROUP BY fertility_zone;
